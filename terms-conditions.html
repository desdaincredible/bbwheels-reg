        <div class="col-sm-12 centered">
            <p>This Road Hazard Plan (“Plan”) is offered by BBWheels, LLC, and administered by Automotive Business Solutions (“Program Administrator”) P.O. Box 33535, Denver, CO 80233. This Plan covers only the new tires you purchased, the original purchaser and the original vehicle identified on the registration. This Plan only applies to passenger and light truck tires, which, during its tread life or within the covered period of time, becomes unserviceable because of a road hazard. A road hazard occurs when a tire fails due to a puncture, bruise or break incurred during the course of normal driving on a maintained road. Nails, glass, and potholes would be the most common examples of road hazard damage.</p>

        <div class="col-sm-12 centered">
            <p><strong>YOU MUST REGISTER YOUR TIRES WITHIN 15 DAYS OF PURCHASE TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE ROAD HAZARD PROGRAM COVERAGE. YOU MAY REGISTER THE TIRES AT <a href="https://tirewarranty.com/reg/" target="_blank">WWW.TIREWARRANTY.COM</a></strong></p>

            <h2>WHAT YOU MUST DO TO OBTAIN SERVICE</h2>
            <p><strong>You must contact the Program Administrator by calling 866-830-4189 for tire replacement, tire replacement or flat tire changing assistance.  <u>Prior authorization must be obtained to replace a tire damaged by a road hazard.</u>  YOU MUST PRESENT THE ORIGINAL INVOICE SHOWING THE PURCHASE OF THE TIRE(S).  The damaged tire must be made available for inspection by the facility and/or the Program Administrator.</strong>  All claims and any required documentation must be submitted to the Program Administrator within 60 days of the date of failure and/or service.  This Plan does not have a deductible.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-sm-12 centered">
            <h2>WHAT IS COVERED BY THE PLAN</h2>
            <p>The Plan is valid for the (“Coverage Period”)  of twelve (12) months from the date of registration or for the first 3/32 of an inch of tread wear, whichever occurs first.</p>

            <p><strong><u>Tire Replacement:</u></strong> If an eligible tire becomes unserviceable because of a road hazard during the Coverage Period, it will be replaced with a new tire. If available, an exact make/model replacement tire will be installed. If not available, a comparable quality tire will be installed.  If the tire failure occurs within the Coverage Period, and cannot be safely repaired per manufacturer’s guidelines, the tire will be replaced with the same, or substantially similar, tire as originally equipped up to one hundred percent (100%) of  the original retail price paid for the tire, as stated on the original retail sales invoice.  You will be responsible for any taxes, mounting, balancing, and any other miscellaneous fees.    If you want a Plan on the replacement tire, you must purchase a new Plan for the new tire.</p>

            <p><strong><u>Tire Repair:</u></strong> If your tire is damaged due to a road hazard and can be safely repaired, the tire will be repaired per manufacturer’s guidelines at any participating facility. The Plan will cover up to $25.00 to have the tire repaired. The Plan will remain in effect.</p>

            <p><strong><u>Flat Tire Changing Assistance:</u></strong> During the term of the Coverage Period, you may receive flat tire changing assistance by calling the service provider of your choice. If you need assistance locating a service provider in your area, you may call 866-830-4189. You will be reimbursed up to $75.00 for eligible expenses incurred for flat tire changing assistance. Flat tire changing assistance is strictly limited to the installation of your useable spare tire. If you require a tow or any other service, you are solely responsible for those charges. This benefit applies only to motorized passenger vehicles and specifically <strong>excludes trailers, or those vehicles listed under the Exclusions and Limitations section below.</strong> To receive reimbursement the following documentation must be submitted to the program administrator within sixty (60) days of service:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><p>A copy of the original sales invoice.</p></li>
                <li><p>A copy of the paid invoice for the spare tire installation from a valid auto service provider. The paid invoice must detail the name, address and phone number of the service provider.</p></li>

            </ol>

            <p>Submit the above documentation to <a href="mailto:"roadsideassistance@abswarranty.net">roadsideassistance@abswarranty.net</a> or to Roadside Assistance, P.O. Box 33535 Denver, CO 80233.</p>
