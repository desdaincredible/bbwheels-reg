        <p>This Road Hazard Plan ("Plan") is offered by the selling dealer from which you
        purchased the tires, provided and administered by Automotive Business Solutions. This Plan covers only
        the new tires you purchased (not available on used tires), the original purchaser and the original
        vehicle identified on the original purchase receipt. This Plan only applies to passenger and light truck
        tires, which, during its tread life or within the covered period of time, becomes unserviceable because
        of a road hazard. The Plan and tire purchase must appear on your receipt. A road hazard occurs when a
        tire fails due to a puncture, bruise or break incurred during the course of normal driving on a
        maintained road. Nails, glass, and potholes would be the most common examples of road hazard damage. The
        obligations of the Provider are guaranteed under a reimbursement insurance policy issued by Lyndon
        Southern Insurance Company, 10151 Deerwood Park Blvd., Bldg. 100, Suite 500, Jacksonville, FL 32256.
        They can be contacted directly by calling (800) 888-2738.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-12 centered">
        <h2>WHAT YOU MUST DO TO OBTAIN SERVICE</h2>
        <p><b>If possible, you should return to the facility where you originally purchased this Plan, for tire repair
        or replacement. If you are away from the original selling dealer, you must contact the program administrator by calling
        888-450-2808 for assistance in locating the nearest participating facility.</b><u>Prior authorization
        must be obtained to replace a tire damaged by a road hazard.</u></p>
        
        <p>YOU MUST PRESENT THE ORIGINAL INVOICE SHOWING THE PURCHASE OF THE TIRE(S) AND THE PLAN.
        The damaged tire must be made available for inspection by the facility and/or the Program Administrator.All
        claims and any required documentation must be submitted to the facility or the Program Administrator within
        60 days of the date of failure and/or service.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-12 centered">
        <h2>WHAT IS COVERED BY THE PLAN</h2>
        <p>The Plan is valid for a period of 1 year or until any portion of the tire is worn to 2/32 of an inch or
        less, whichever occurs first.</p>

        <p><b>Tire Replacement:</b> If a tire becomes unserviceable because of a road hazard during the useable
        tread life of the tire, it will be replaced with a new tire. If available, an exact make/model
        replacement tire will be installed. If not available, a comparable quality tire will be installed. If
        the tire failure occurs within the first 33% of useable treadwear, and cannot be safely repaired per
        manufacturer's guidelines, the tire will be replaced with coverage up to 100% of the original price paid
        for the tire. After the first 33% of useable treadwear, you will be charged for the consumed useable
        treadwear on the original tire, times the original selling price of the tire. You will be responsible
        for any taxes, mounting, balancing, and any other miscellaneous fees. When the tread is worn down to
        2/32" the tire is considered worn out and is not eligible for adjustment. If you want a Plan on the
        replacement tire, you must purchase a new Plan for the new tire.</p>

        <p><b>Tire Repair:</b> If your tire is damaged due to a road hazard and can be safely repaired, the tire
        will be repaired per manufacturer's guidelines at any participating facility. The Plan will cover up
        $20.00 to have the tire repaired. The Plan will remain in effect.</p>
